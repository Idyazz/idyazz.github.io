- Live Site URL: https://idyazz.github.io/


## THE PROCESS

- Created the HTML and added custom fonts Fraunces and Montserrat
- Uploaded images to postimages.org
- Specified the images required based on user's device in the html
- Created a css stylesheet and layed out the design with a mobile first approach. This ensures that the website displays properly whether the user is using a phone, tablet, or desktop
- Started working on CSS styles in this order; container, image, title, item, description, discount price, original price, add to cart button, and finally the attribution at the bottom
- added a special feature where if you hover over the add to cart button it transitions into a lighter green with a dark shadow behind it, as well as slighty increasing in size

### BUILT WITH

- Visual Studio Code
- CSS styles
- HTML
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### WHAT I LEARNED

I learned how to create a website using the mobile first approach, as well as create and style a button.


### CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

I need to continue focusing on the grid layout for websites as I am still not familiar with it.


### USEFUL RESOURCES

1. https://www.w3schools.com/ - This site was very useful since I was able to learn new html attributes and css styles that I didn't know about.
